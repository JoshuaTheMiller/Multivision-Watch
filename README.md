# Multivision-Watch

👁⌚👁 *Need I say more?*

...*probably*. Multivision-Watch = Pluralsight (get it?) Watchface

Pluralsight Live is coming up soon, and I'm fairly excited! As such, I thought it would be fitting to create a new watch face to commemorate such an event. 

Disclaimer: it has been a while since I've created a watch face from scratch, and the ConnectIQ platform has changed and matured. If you're interested in making your own watch face, please read Garmin's documentation, as this repository should not be taken as a reflection of best practices.

This repository is for a [watch face for Garmin watches](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/e0a26568-1c87-44a6-99ed-2de2955dff07).
