Pluralsight Live is coming up soon, and I'm fairly excited! As such, I thought it would be fitting to create a new watch face to commemorate such an event.

As Plurasight is all about learning, I've created a public repository with the source code for this watch face: https://github.com/JoshuaTheMiller/Multivision-Watch. I'll be creating a blog post about this watch face soon. I will add a link to this listing when the post is public.

Disclaimer: it has been a while since I've created a watch face from scratch, and the ConnectIQ platform has changed and matured. If you're interested in making your own watch face, please read Garmin's documentation, as my repository should not be taken as a reflection of best practices.

# Some notes

The color scheme for this face was inspired by the colors present on the badge attendees receive. Please note that some watches cannot display the same range of colors, so your experience with this may be different than what is shown in the cover image. The screenshots should provide a good range of experiences, so please look at those so you will know what to expect.

# Features
